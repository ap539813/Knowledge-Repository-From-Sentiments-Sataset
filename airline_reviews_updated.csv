Flew from Glasgow to New York via LHR, the seats have zero storage apart from the small drawer at floor level. It is astonishing that for the money they charge, you have to step over the legs of the person on your outside, especially if you accidentally trip and land on top of them. Food was satisfactory although a small bacon roll for breakfast was again a poor show. AVOD was also satisfactory. Apart from the flat bed, this just really doesn't have a premium feel about it. On our recent trip, on both legs, the crew were excellent, but the product from our national flag carrier simply is not worth the premium prices they charge."

Nice champagne and a nice quiet ambiance which I like. The place is starting to show signs of wear and tear - with sagging seat cushions. Plane was latest 1st Class and there was only 7 passengers including my wife and I. It seemed a little larger than the 1st I travelled on a month ago on an A380. Maybe it was because of the hideous centre console (that houses he folding table) was smaller - rather than take up half the space. To start we had a small  appetizer  (an Amuse Bouche) which was absolutely hideous. A sort of grilled cheese with burnt bits on it and some sort of couscous. It was foul and we left the lot. Both had a langoustine starter which was ok. The mushrooms with it was wet and horrible texture to the mouth. The soup we both had was nice. My cod dish was very good. My wife said the steak two ways was ok. The braised part she did not eat. Wines all ok. Service from the FAs was fine. In terms of overall quality BA really fail consistently to deliver. As a matter of curiosity I sourced the on way price the day before we left; £5543 - one way. Its an insane price and if I paid that I would be furious as to the product I experienced. Travelling in 1st is only worth it on  sale  offers or Avios. We are travelling back in Club as in my experienced the slightly shorter flight home in First is not worth the money or the Avios. So disappointing. BA really are clueless when it comes to understanding  quality .

Check in at JFK was efficient. Fast track through to security was a breeze. BA's Galleries Lounge at JFK T7 was shared with Cathay Pacific and LOT Polish Airline. The lounge was spacious and clean. I was encouraged to have my dinner in the lounge as the service is a sleeper service. To my disappointmwnt, there wasn't enough food left although the selections were good but not the best. After my pre-flight dining, I decided to have a shower. The shower rooms were clean and amenities available on request. BA's Club World seat is around 20 inches wide which was very comfortable for the quick 5 hour flight back home. I was greeted by my name by the cabin crew who were friendly. IFE option was the same as flying economy clasd. Menu was handed out a along with Elemis amenity kit. The meals were good but portions could be better. Upon arrival in LHR, bags were delivered on time. I was told to pay a visit to their arrivals lounge but I didn't bother. Overall, I would fly with BA's Club World product again. Seat and bed was very comfortable and well maintained despite the ageing aircraft. Cabin crew friendly and enthusiastic. Just one thing that BA might want to consider is the food portions because their portions are baby sized portions."

Bag drop at Terminal 5 quick and hassle free, checked in online so had my boarding pass on my phone. Security was busy at 13.00 but had an hour so no panic. First time I have used BA in 5 years without having access to the lounge through my frequent flyer status but the hour in the terminal pleasant. Boarding quick and seat 7A was spacious departed 20 minutes late with a 10 minute late arrival. Crew nice with a drink and snack provided on a 55 min flight. Return I had no checked baggage so straight through Terminal 2A which is a nice experience with shops and food outlets. Boarding at 17.45 for an 18.00 departure on to a half full A319, departed a little late which meant a late arrival in to T5. A nice flight, nice crew a drink and snack provided. Seat 24A with enough room. Pleasant trip for a short flight, I don't feel it's worth the extra cost for a business class seat, economy was fine. Will use again."

Ground service at London/Heathrow Terminal 5 is smooth and no hassle. Check in and security was very fast and efficient. I particularly like BA's boarding procedure at Heathrow, very orderly and organised regardless of the fullness of the flight. Onboard the A380 is BA's new 'World Traveller' cabin on the main deck at 3x4x3 configuration. BA offers 31.5 inches legroom compared to CX's 32 inches and it was surprisingly very comfortable with the slim design seats. IFE had a few glitches but the FA's were happy to assist and worked perfectly throughout the flight. However, more movies, TV programmes and music options could be offered. Meals were mediocre. Drinks were served around an hour after take off. Meals followed straight after. Lunch meal option was either curry, vegetarian pasta or chicken and often for the latter. Surprisingly good but still not as good as CX. Portions could be better. Drinks were offered throughout the flight along with snack boxes. Pre-landing meal was also given with two options: pasta or chicken casserole, I went for the latter. Again, portions could be better. Overall, I would fly long haul with BA again on their new product (A380, B777-300ER and B787)."

Been a while since I last flew British Airways, sad to see the same old planes in use and now very much looking their age for domestic use. Technical issues delayed departure, normal sure, but the noise the plane made on taxi lasted far too long and was slightly alarming and not the norm. Seat pitch belongs on a dodgy charter not the national carrier surely? Last time flown I got a nice sandwich and drink, this time it's small bag of crisps and juice? It's time BA stopped taking it's domestic (no competition routes) for granted and upgrade the fleet on short trips, the numbers onboard justify a better level of service considering the extra fees now attached for checked in luggage versus just carry on, puts me off using their long haul option with ever increasing fees whilst oil prices have been rock bottom for how long now?

As a British Citizen you desperately want to like BA but they do make it very difficult to do so. The recent documentary  A Very British Airline  whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to BA particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. Sadly on all the legs the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. Attendants chewing gum no smiles everything was all too much effort. The only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort.

On the return flight, I was on a Boeing 777 and although slightly more modern, the entertainment again was limited and the control unit didn't work. The staff were better than the previous flight. However British Airways did manage to mislay my baggage between NYC and Manchester and I received it 24hours later (battered and missing some clips and thankfully nothing broken inside). I've decided that whenever I fly eastw I'll continue using Emirates or Singapore Airlines (both of a far higher quality than British Airways) and to the USA maybe Virgin (have to be better than BA surely?). I'll never use BA again."

Having travelled out WT Plus to Miami we got a good deal coming back from Tampa so flew Club Class. Checked in at Tampa with no queues, and used the International Lounge at Tampa. Supposed to be exclusive to BA customers this had comfortable seats, and good choice of newspapers and magazines. Did not try WiFi. However, there was disappointingly very poor choice of snacks - a few dried up sorry looking sandwiches which were not replenished during my time there, and crackers with some processed cheese with a few dips, some wine, beer, liquor and soft drinks. Pretty uninspiring stuff. On board comfortable, if narrow, seats that extended into (more or less) flat beds. British Airways still have the very camped 2-4-2 layout with fellow passengers having to clamber over people to go to the rest room etc. Reasonable meal (beef) accompanied by an outstanding Chablis Premier Cru and a very nice Sauvignon Blanc. My wife slept for 5 straight hours - I could only sleep fitfully as not much room at shoulder level but at least the seats were comfortable. Terrible selection of films on the entertainment system. Took off on time, and landed slightly early. FA's quite smiley and nice."

Flight itself was okay but on arrival we were  parked  a long way from the baggage reclaim area (for which the Captain apologised). After a 30 minute walk from the plane our problems began as we then waited another more than 2 hours for our luggage to arrive. Many flights that landed a long time after us received our bags and set off home far more promptly. BA have acknowledged they are responsible for the journey from  start to finish  but have gone on to advise that some parts of the operation are sub contracted including this part. Can't recommend BA because of this experience and because of the way our subsequent complaint has been handled. Not planning to use BA again because of this.

You used to get wider seats and more leg room than economy. Not any more. Same seats as economy but with middle seat blocked. Breakfast ok but not brilliant. Staff were good and I enjoyed the champagne but was it worth paying for club class? No it wasn't. We were lucky and got row 2 by the food galley which meant extra legroom but that was more luck than design. I wouldn't fly Club Europe again unless I was guaranteed this seat but to get it I would have to pay £18 per person each way on top of the club fares. Total rip off BA. Before we flew I was going to book British Airways to Bangkok. Based on this experience though I'll stick to EVA Air. Additionally the club lounge at Gatwick was dire. No seats available on arrival, cooked meal inedible and the lounge was not exclusive to BA and was clearly being used by all and sundry who paid a few quid for the use of a lounge. The tables were also filthy."

The trip got off to a good start with the Concorde lounge at Terminal 5. Very comfortable and private, however showing signs of wear and tear. Needs a bit of a refurb. Boarding was announced and we promptly left, however only just made it to the gate. (Very odd, but I am no fan of the trains to the strange satellite terminals for boarding.) The plane was a very old refurbished Boeing 747-400. Quite why BA hangs on to these gas guzzlers is a mystery. I estimate the plane, over its life so far, has done about 90 million miles (enough to get to the moon). Much criticism has been said about cramming so many First suites into the nose of the plane, and I can say that is fully justified. It was a day flight so not worried about sleeping, but if it were a night flight as a tall (but not overweight) man I would struggle to get comfortable. It’s like a coffin and storage space for personal effects not worth a light. A cabin crew told me they will hang on to the newer Boeing 747-400s for another 5-10 years. If so, this is truly unbelievable. Given the Emirates competition on this route, their fantastic suites and they always serve caviar, one does wonder if the sales and marketing people at British Airways have a clue how to entice customers to the overall experience. There is so much criticism of British Airways on this site, one wonders why they don’t listen. It can only be perceived as arrogance. Food was fine. Very nice mezza, nice soup and spicy Middle Eastern style chicken; not bad at all. Champagne very basic and Krug has long vanished from British Airways routes. Cabin crew were terrific – faultless. Travelling a Boeing 777 on the way back. Hopefully a better seat."

However to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. On checking in online seats had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply was  cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in . Check in, no response. On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be  normal  passengers, i.e. no entourage. Seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. BA Club Lounge: Again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and friendly. Food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that  that was good . Entertainment: Poor, old  ish  and second rate movies, enough said. Seats: Unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. Having flown Qantas, Emirates and Qatar A380's like everybody else we wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. Well we know why = £££'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear glasses? There is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. Again, competitors manage it. The seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. Unfortunately, we do still have to use BA next March, but have booked Qatar again for October. Additionally, the Customer Service service in India is sadly woefully short in all areas, although polite working from scripts and unable to solve / answer simple questions. Frustration. A question for BA: We really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentives for using BA? I do not mean cost."

I am sure this didn't make the cabin crew job easy but they seemed quite disorganised - running out of drinks etc. As we were sitting in the back of the plane there seemed to be no choices by the time we were offered food - the crew were not really interested. When asked about an alternative they forgot to come back to us and when asked again they offered exactly what we refused. The food was poor quality, dry hard chicken with very little flavour. Breakfast was an egg mayonnaise roll and again there was no alternative.

It was just bad luck that we'd had to rebook flights I explained that it was a BA manager who told me to claim and it wouldn't take much to actually find out who flew on the flight. But still, no. Our insurance won't pay either because we didn't have a long enough delay! Ok, legally, BA may be in the right, but morally, well. Even the insurance company thought there should be a bit of leeway.

Finally I choose the ice cream for dessert. Landed on time and got our bags quickly.

I travel regularly in business class on Emirates, normally on the same equipment. The BA configuration upstairs is quite cramped and far inferior to other Airlines, even to the extent of having to stretch over other passengers to leave your seat. In addition the staff seem preoccupied with their own arrangements and although were fine with me, were mildly irritated with the requests of other passengers, openly commenting to each other in front of me. The cleanliness of the plane also left a lot to be desired, after only a couple of hours into the flight, the toilets were disgusting with the floor awash - I don't think crew check them on a regular basis. The window seat has side stowage facilities, which in my case had a disgusting pale yellow fluid and rubbish in it. When mentioned to crew, they did get some paper towels to dry it out, but needless to say I didn't use it (photo attached). Overall poor value for money."

Started badly - at check-in and gate boarding World Traveller passnegers are made to feel second-class citizens, but this seemed worse at Bengaluru (choatic) than Heathrow. The plane itself was packed to capacity, probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route. World Traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration. I had chosen an aisle seat in the centre (seat 38D) at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passengers. Leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat has plenty of space underneath. Seat width is OK. The adjustable headrest is better than that in Premium Economy (World Traveller Plus) although the seat base is hard. For a 10 hour flight I recommend sitting on the cushion. Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success. Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff. To be expected to put up with a seat without VOD for 10 hours is ridiculous - why do BA not check them after each flight? Plenty of food (breakfast after 2hrs, in then a snack box after 5hrs, then lunch after 8hrs) but, unfortunately, while I thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first, that was not the case, and by the time they got to my row all choice was gone. No connectivity in seat, only earphone socket. VOD choice quite limited compared to other airlines. Unfortunately I think that British Airways have been overtaken these days and will look to the Middle and Far Eastern carriers in future."

One male cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely, it was astounding that he could still be allowed to fly.

This flight proved that it is the crew that make a good or bad flight. This one was really bad. I was booked in Club normally the plane is a three class 777. On Friday it was a four class that was flying and I was lucky enough to be seated in the First Class cabin. Although it was not classed as an upgrade to First because it was business class service it should still have been a lovely experience. Yes the seat and all the space was great but the first words I heard as being offered a drink was -  Can't wait for this flight to be over . This was from one of the stewards to another steward but that attitude was the same amongst all the crew serving the cabin. I hope BA read this forum as the service really was appalling. My husband was in the bathroom when breakfast was served he was ignored. A request of a cup of coffee was met with we will be landing in 40 minutes.

I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that  I would not get breakfast . I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. There are plenty of other first class carriers out there that I will now become a customer of.

The IFE was good and the 2 hot meals served quite tasty and filling. In addition, the cabin crew were again excellent. On the way back flight was more than 2.5hrs late out of BOM which would have meant a missed connection at LHR late Saturday night, the last flight out to HEL that night. Asked the BOM station manager to be put on Jet Airways since they seemed to be on time, had to wait until the very last minute due to a fully booked flight, but finally got two seats on Jet to catch the connecting flight at LHR the same evening.

They warned us that the lounge at Gatwick was closed and we used the No 1 lounge instead. Acceptable, but not of similar quality to the BA product we would have wished for. The outbound flight had a scheduled departure time of 15.25. Delayed 4 hours due to a combination of 1) French ATC strike (2 hours) 2) Blocked toilet on aircraft (20 minutes) 3) Change of seating configuration of the A320 that we were allocated (resulting in 13 economy passengers being bumped (45 minutes) 4) No ground crew to push us back from gate (remainder). Pilot and cabin crew did their best but were getting frustrated as were the passengers. Took off, reasonable inflight service outbound. Return flight, no lounge in Seville, no warning from BA on this. Reasonable inflight service. Slow baggage at LGW (so no surprise there!). Overall, reasonable product and I feel still worth the extra (but only just)."

Sydney to Singapore was a reward flight and I probably wouldn't pay as much as other airlines for this product, but if it was cheaper than competitors I would pick it. Seats a bit narrow but otherwise acceptable and I like the fact you can slide the table away and get out easily. Service was top notch and very surprised, had an excellent stewardess in our area. Meal service with two salads and some nice bread along with a decent main. Small snack before landing - I always feel that a bigger option should be provided on a 7 hour flight, since it is too small for you not to have to eat again when you arrive. IFE had a good selection and worked fine. I like the way they have set out the Club World cabin - it is a bit different and although crowded it is calm and professional. Obviously the seats do not compare to the best out there. If they were materially cheaper than say Singapore Airlines or Emirates then I would take it. If they want to charge a similar price then obviously the product is not the same quality."

I am adding another one. I have flown BA on/of for 37 years. I guess that makes me qualified to write a review. My main gripe is the total lack of value for money. The erosion of quality and services and the sky rocketing prices. This flight from Heathrow to Barcelona and the return - accentuates the lack of value. Barcelona flights operates out of Terminal 3 at LHR. Quite why BA use this ageing and outdated terminal is a mystery. You walk miles and if you are unfamiliar with this point, as we were, - you end up running a panicked race to the gate. Its worse on arrivals. Immigration and passport control was a zoo. The T3 Business lounge is mediocre, Plastic tables and chairs. The most awful selection of dried out bacon baps and dried out omelettes stuffed into baguettes. The seating areas overlooking the airport was cluttered with newspapers. There was plenty of booze. Flight left on time. The meal inflight I could not be bothered with. FAs all fine. On the return the shared lounge was surprisingly good. More comfortable than T3 at LHR. Ageing plane. Mediocre afternoon tea. Frumpy FAs who  forgot  to hand out our Fast Track tickets to help speed up through immigration. (We got held up for half an hour.) On both flights we had to endure the silly Club Europe seats - basically two seats - with the middle seat closed down into a table. Cramped leg room. Definitely no value here. I only fly BA when I have to. It really needs a clean out of the management and a new team with some vision on how to make British Airways a world leader - which right now they fail miserably to achieve, in all their cabins."

I booked a flight to Florence through BA website, received a British Airways e-ticket and only found out on the day when trying to check in that I was flying with Vueling. Never heard of them. To cut a very long story short we were delayed 8 hours, nothing said to us and nothing offered at this stage. At the gate, when we finally got there, one of the customers checked their website to find the flight had not left Italy yet. We informed the ground staff. They did not day a thing. After half an hour trying to get answers from them we were told we would have to wait till the next flight arrived (how long we couldn't be told) and they would then fly us to a different airport 2 hours away and arrange a bus transfer. I headed straight back the the terminal and sought a British Airways rep to try and get an answer, firstly because that is who I booked my ticket through and secondly as Vueling have no representation at the airport. I was told it had nothing to do with British Airways and they couldn't help. I explained the situation again and asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was denied that right. I by chance saw a 'Customer Service Representative' walking past 5 minutes later and asked to speak to him. He looked at me as if I had 2 heads and in the end walked away after calling me an 'ar----le'. 100% true, in the middle of Gatwick North Terminal. My wife and 6 week old child were themselves waiting at Florence 4 hours for me. We were told Vueling were going to try and get us out the following day. But no guarantees. I booked another flight with British Airways to get to my family, and British Airways have offered nothing, not even an apology. Vueling will refund our flight if we go through the correct procedures. British Airways should be ashamed of what they have become."

My husband and I travelled on separate bookings and were flying back from London to Sydney together. I phoned British Airways 3 days before my flight from London to ask them to link our booking numbers so we would be seated on the flight together. I was informed they could link the numbers but not guarantee we would be seated next to each other. However if I wanted to buy my seat in advance then this would be guaranteed. I was not giving this money-grabbing airline another opportunity to take more money from me so I refused this option. My husband tweeted the airline and received two more replies stating they could not help with this. When online check in opened my husband and I were allocated seats 10 rows apart and could not change this. Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped, who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the Singapore-Sydney leg. This woman did not even work for British Airways but was the most helpful. Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this. The cabin crew on both flights clearly did not enjoy working in Economy. A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane). I will only be flying with Emirates or Singapore Airlines in the future who know how to look after their passengers."

From their response it is quite clear they do not see AA as part of the same group  one world alliance  I used to be of the view that I didn't mind paying a bit more for BA as their service was really good, but unfortunately they now seem to offer a budget airline service.

This is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. The aircraft was a 747-400 reg G-CIVV built in 1998. The aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and LED lighting. However the aircraft tables were not clean, leg room was poor and the 747 is  an embarrassment .

The new First product is excellent. The service was greatthe seats comfortable, inflight entertainment very good, and the food was well presented, with a good choice of wines. I slept well, and actually enjoyed the journey - one I do very regularly on other carriers but chose BA this time for a change. Bags were tagged as priority but in Sydney they came out after about 120 other pieces of luggage, meaning I nearly missed my onward connection to Melbourne. Staff gossip in the galleys - it's a flimsy curtain and I don't want to hear about staff boyfriend troubles, holiday plans, or crew roster. Cleanliness of the toilets is the responsibility of the staff to monitor, but in First the toilets are too cramped, and I ended up wiping the toilet floor myself with tissues and sanitary wipes because I didn't know what that liquid on the floor was. While safety and the journey are the most important things, it's these  Attention to detail  items that make or break the service experience. BA ground crew, ticketing agents, cabin crew, pilots are commendable, but British Airways needs to help them to get the service right."

Check-in process was fine at Heathrow. After security, I went to the first class lounge on the south side of Heathrow terminal 5. The lounge had no air conditioning and so was very hot as it was a fairly warm day outside - this made it quite uncomfortable. The hot food selection was poor - everything was very liquid based and looked unappetizing. There were a few bland sandwiches available as well. While the lounge itself is in a beautiful, large room, it is really let down by the lack of good food and service. Boarding process was seamless at the gate. The plane had been recently renovated but the seats were highly uncomfortable. There is very little legroom available and if you're taller than 5'11 , you're knees will likely be touching the seat in front of you. Food offering was very limited with only a small bag of chips on offer and one drink. Flight attendants were courteous but didn't really go beyond the minimum. No inflight entertainment or wifi whatsoever was available, which is really a disappointment given that so many other airlines are now installing this.

So why no extra staff to cope with this? Plane then cancelled 30 mins after time, due to technical issue. No systems in place to cope with the size of what then needed to be done. Everyone had to re-claim baggage, exit via passport control and queue at service desk to re-book. Unbelievably, desk staffed by only one person. People with onward connections were being given priority so their journey could be re-planned but each of these took 10 to 15 mins to process, with a line of 100+ people waiting behind. Thus by the time one person had been served another had been prioritised to front of queue, meaning that the queue was effectively not moving. Over 3 hours later a third of the queue was still standing in line waiting to be processed. It was only the self-discipline of those in the queue that prevented this descending into total chaos. Why not two terminals so the onward travellers could be dealt with separately from those with simple needs? Why no seating and no queue management system? Pathetic response to what must be a an occasional problem. Then had to re-present to re-check-in again via their slow 'new system' and go again through security (mercifully top class) and passport control for evening flight.

I also flew a longer sector (Kiev to London) last week and it was awful. On the A319 they only have 1 toilet at the rear of the plane for all economy passenger. On a 4 hour flight this resulted in massive queues discomforting passenger on the last 4-5 rows as well as long waits for those actually using the loo. The food was horrendous (Chicken Kiev!) and the air hostesses were surly, abrupt and really uninterested and unfriendly. I don't want them to do the fake smile and friendliness thing, but these girls and guys were genuinely unhappy and unfriendly. As for my regular weekly or biweekly flights between Dublin and LCY or LHR, the E170 service to LCY is ok, it's punctual, and you get a stale croissant for breakfast on it. What really annoys me is how British Airways treats its frequent flyers, makes it impossible to get any meaningful benefit from BA despite having travelled numerous times with them (every other week at least!) and paid hundreds of pounds in fares that are usually well above the competition. They also have this  seat selection  fee for their bronze members if they book a hand luggage only fare. They cite that these fares are there to make it competitive but they really are not anywhere near competitive on routes they sell from Dublin and the treatment of regular flyers and bronze members leaves a lot to be desired (it's basically meaningless: I would have far better service on Cityjet or Aer Lingus which both server those routes, for a lower fare, while being able to choose my seat for free at check-in time). As a result, I am seriously considering my use of British Airways."

I was bumped off this British Airways flight as a result of a change of plane, to an A319 I gather. The process was not well handled, and it appeared that some staff and/or standby passengers were given priority, although others also missed out I understand. The main issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what the issue was, last-minute confirmation of offloading (which left us short of time to take another flight), a poor process for transferring airports (I had to bus from Gatwick to Heathrow), and poor follow-up when I queried matters afterwards. BA refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised, repeatedly citing privacy. I checked with a friend who's a UK privacy legal specialist, and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby, so it appears to be a refusal by BA to respond. I also raised the transfer with BA, as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket, which meant I missed a transfer bus. Better to issue a ticket, or a voucher that can be used on any service that day, with BA to arrange it so with the bus company. On the positive side, I was compensated per the rules, and did make a BA flight later that day, which was OK. Nonetheless, this could have been handled much more smoothly, and I'm afraid British Airways customer service on the ground and in follow-up let them down."

I then got a message at 8pm at night to say they had found my bag and the courier was picking it up at 10pm and then it would be delivered. So I specifically stayed home that night And finally decided at midnight they were not going to deliver it so went to sleep. I woke up and called British Airways at 9am to ask when it was going to arrive and where was it as I got a message saying it was being picked up at 10pm the night before so had stayed home. They said to call the courier company. I then called the courier company and they said that it was a mistake and they would never deliver a bag that Late at night. They then said the driver had a late night so wouldn't arrive until lunch time that day. so I went out for the morning and returned to my apartment at lunch. I then received a message at lunch time that said they would actually not arrive until sometime between 3 and 5pm that afternoon. I called to see if I could get a more specific time or they could tell me when they were on the way. They said no, and that I would have to wait at my apartment for two hours and to call at 6pm if my bag had not arrived. This was ridiculous. I am so lucky my air BnB hosts supplied me with towels and a toothbrush and that I had money to go out and buy clothes for the day. So unimpressed with British Airways and their disorganisation with my bag. I understand bags are lost but to be told that it was coming at three different times and also the fact that British Airways decided it had nothing to do with them anymore and to contact the courier company was a joke.

The food didn't sit well on the stomach, and trying to drink an alcoholic beverage just made it worse. I ordered a vegetarian meal, and was served a very bland and flavorless pasta. When breakfast was served I was given the same dish. The crew was careless and seemingly did not want to hear about my problems.
