      "Home is our abode of love where we expect to enjoy the fruits of our labor. We expect to enjoy our peace  happiness progress  prosperity health  wealth and faith  spiritual development from our home. If its surroundings and construction are poor and the atmosphere eerie we can neither be happy nor healthy. Hence to ensure that the house is built properly in modern times we take the help of the professionals who can build a good house with a solid foundation strong walls a proper structural balance with the right weight and pressure distribution proper plumbing electricity air light etc. This branch of modern knowledge is called architecture or civil engineering.\n",
      "The ancient seers of India knew not only the above but quite a few other things beyond. Hence their house building principles included the NorthSouth flow of magnetic forces the EastWest earth motion and Solar energy forces and with Divine Spiritual Perception they also knew the various Deities who rule the different sections of the house and based on the Nature of the Deities what type of roomfunction is ideal in that part of the house Details given in the section Vastu Purusha Mandala. This branch of ancient Indian knowledge is called Vastu Sastra or Vastu Shilpa sastra or Vastu Nirmana sastra. It was employed to build not just houses but to plan and build entire towns and cities and temples.\n",
      "During the last 10 years first Vastu was in fashion then it became a fad then came fanaticism and now the society is full of blind beliefs. People with all kinds of false notions are rejecting excellent houses just because they are facing the west. The truth is that there is nothing against a west facing house in Vastu Self styled Vastu expert consultants are taking people for a ride.\n",
      "The Vastu principles included on which sides of the plot the roads should be the size  shape of the plot how far minimum away it should be from the public places what type of plothouse should be there next to the house the heightlengthbreath of the boundary  the rooms and their placementfunction the door  window placement etc. It makes the optimised ideal use of the magnetic solar  spiritual forces and the five basic elements  Earth Fire Water Air  Space. The principles are based on very practical reasons. For example if the East side boundary wall is too high one will not get enough sunlight.\n",
      "Like any other ancient sastra Vastu must also be understood interpreted and implemented based on the changed socioeconomic conditions. Take for example the rule Bathroom should not be next to kitchen  fire and water must be away. This is because in those days the kitchenfire was produced by burning either wood or coal and bathroom water source was a well. So this would dampen the fire woodcoal. In the modern kitchen if you have a gas stove at one corner and a tap and sink at the other corner its not going to take you to hell. Similarly the toilet in those days was an open space and for hygienic reasons used to be at the end of the house. But the modern toilets are ok to be attached to bed rooms.\n",
      "In modern times especially in cities only a multi millionaire can follow all the Vastu rules. The rest 99 especially the flat dwellers can only do the best adjustments. Vastu is like life where you want ideal parents ideal brothers  sisters ideal teachers  education ideal job  money ideal wife  children and ideal health. This is rarely possible and hence you have to live with and make the best of what you get.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following pages will give you the authentic Vastu principles. Read them and you can understand Vastu. At least no one can take you for a ride.\n",
      "One final word. At the time of entering a new house if you get a vastu shanti pooja done which is part of the Griha Pravesh pooja it takes care of the Vastu doshas. Vastu cannot adversely affect the house where God is regularly worshiped with pooja stotra path or mantra japa. Keeping a Vastu Ganesha at the Pooja place is another antidote to all Vastu Doshas. For the past 3 years I have been living in a flat where every thing is totally wrong according to Vastu but this house has given me more peace prosperity fame and money than all the other good Vastu houses. And mind you I am going through the peak of my sadesati and Rahu antardasa God power is always stronger than Vastu power.\n",
      "The Legend of Vastu Sashtra\n",
      "The ancient Indian text Mayamata written thousands of years ago describes Vastu Sastra  the science of ancient Indian architecture. Hindu mythology explains the history of how it all started.\n",
      "In the beginning Brahma the creator of the Universe experimented with the creation of a new creature. He created a large and monstrous creature that grew so rapidly that its shadow fell on the earth as a permanent eclipse. After that this ever growing monster began to devour everything in its path as nothing could satisfy its insatiable hunger.\n",
      "Shiva and Vishnu begged Brahma to do something before everything was destroyed by this Creature. Brahma realised his mistake and called the astha dikapalakas the Gods of the eight cardinal directions. Together they overpowered the Great Monster and held it flat against the earth. Then Brahma jumped in the middle and held the monster down. He then asked another forty four Gods to join him and help pin it down. Their 45 positions can be seen on the classic mandala of the Vastu Grid.\n",
      "Then the Monster cried You created me like this. So why am I being punished for what you made me Brahma offered him a compromise and made the Monster immortal with the boon that he would be worshipped by any mortal that builds a structure on earth. He was named Vastu Purusha\n",
      "Vastu Purusha  Vastu Mandala\n",
      "The diagram bellow known as Vastu Mandala illustrates how the Vastu Purusha was pinned down by Brahma and the 44 Gods  face down with his head to the North East and feet towards South West. It is divided in to 99  81 parts. These Gods rule various aspects of life and have certain inherent qualities. Hence while constructing a building the purposefunction of a room must be in tune with the nature of the deity placed and ruling that part. This is illustrated in the next picture. Not many houses are likely to have that many rooms.\n",
      "Hence adjustments can be made by combining several areas. One noteworthy point is that in the olden days the central portion ruled by Brahma was kept open.\n",

      "Vastu Sashtra  Land  plot\n",
      "Situation of Plot A land that was a burial ground or a crematorium is not suitable for living. Ideally it should be flat level ground. A land on a hill is also not a suitable. If it is on a slope then the land sloping down toward the north or east is ok but if it is sloping to the west it is not good.\n",
      "A valley or a large pit around the land or a depression in the land is inauspicious. A plot situated between two larger plots is not good as it brings poverty.\n",
      "If the plot is next to a bridge it is not auspicious  particularly if the bridge is on the north or east side. You can compromise if it is on the south or west side.\n",
      "Dont buy a plot with obstructions like hills tall buildings or towers on the north north east or east sides as the suns rays will be blocked. However such things on the west or south sides are auspicious as they bring health wealth and happiness as they block the harmful western rays.\n",
      "Similarly water source located on the southwest side of a building will bring misery. If the plot has a well swimming pool lake river or a stream flowing on the north east it is auspicious.\n",
      "If there is an electrical power supply station or large electric pole on the north east side of the plot it is not good for the vibrations.\n",
      "The plot should not be within twice the distance of the height of the house to any public place like temple hospital factory etc. If the distance is more than that then it is ok. The house should be at least 80 ft or more away from any temple. The gate should not face a temple and the shadow of a temple should not fall on the house.\n",
      "Avoid plots near a meat shop workshop laundry shoe shop etc.\n",
      "The fence or the boundary wall should be higher on the west and south and lower on the north and east sides.\n",

      "The plot with roads running along on all four sides is the best. It brings health wealth and happiness.\n",
      "The plot with roads running along on three sides  on the north west and east is not so good. Roads on the north south and west is also not so good.\n",
      "It is inauspicious if there are three roads only on the east south and west. If there are roads on only the east and north side that is good.\n",
      "If there are roads on the west and north it is average.\n",
      "The plot with a road running along and ending at the northeast corner is very good. But if the road ends on any other part of the plot it is usually not good.\n",
      "A road on the east or north side of the plot is good but a road on the south or west side is not so good.\n",
      "The plot on a T or Y intersection is not auspicious.\n",
      "The best plot is the square one followed by the rectangular one. The four sides of the plot should be towards the four main directions. A hexagon shaped plot  8 even sides is also good.\n",
      "Direction of the plot The direction that the front of a property faces is important. Plot facing East is good for scholars philosophers priests professors teachers etc.\n",
      "Plot facing North is good for those in power administration and those who work for government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plot facing South is good for business class and for those who work in business organisations.\n",
      "Plot facing West is for those who provide supporting services to the society.\n",
      "If the plot of land does not squarely face the four cardinal directions and if the road does not run in one of the four cardinal directions the house should be built facing the four directions\n",
      "Vastu for plot\n",
      "Shape and size of the plot The best shapes for plots of land are square or rectangular facing squarely on the four cardinal directions.\n",
      "It is good if the plot is narrower at the entrance and wider at its rear but the opposite is not good.\n",
      "Round oval and triangular plots should be avoided. The house should not be built in the shape of a diamond with the corner facing north. Lshaped plots are also inauspicious and should not be purchased.\n",
      "If the land is cut in the corner this is not good. If possible the land to fill in the missing corner should be purchased. If the land is cut short on the northeast side it is very bad and is not auspicious do not purchase it. It is like a headless body.\n",
      "A land tilt of 20 degrees off square by 20 degrees is acceptable. If the plot is rectangular it is better that the longer sides run north to south rather than west to east. The best properties are either square or rectangular. If the plot is not a perfect rectangle it is best if at least the southwest and southeast sides of the land are at 90º angles from one another. The southwest side of the quadrilateral should definitely not be extended past the southeast side even if that means giving away a portion of the plot. Land that extends past the northeast side of the quadrilateral however brings wealth happiness and good name. Land extending on the northeast side is very good. Extensions on any other side are inauspicious. Extensions of the northwest side will cause you to lose money and peace.\n",

      "Vastu Size and slope of plot\n",
      "Sloping of the Plot The north east half of the plot is called the Solar half and the South west half is called the Lunar half. Ideally the Solar half should be lower and the Lunar half should be higher. This ensures the ideal flow of light solar energy  polar energy from east and north and water flows from West to East and from South to North. This type of plot brings joy and happiness good children and all the success in life to the occupants of the building erected on it.\n",
      "Avoid plots humped at the center and sloping on all sides. Same with the plots that are depressed at the center.\n",
      "\n",
      "The north east side of the land should be the lowest side. If the northeast side is at a higher elevation than other sides of the property you can dig soil from that one side and use it to build up the other parts. The land should either slope down toward the north or east but not toward the west or south. Land sloping north brings riches sloping east brings good fortune sloping south brings ruin and sloping west brings financial loss. The following chart illustrates the details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soil  land While purchasing land it is ideal to buy land that can be cultivated i.e. where the vegetation can grow. Land with too many rocks worms bones and thorny trees is not considered good. If it is high at the center and sloping towards the sides it is not good.\n",
      "During the ancient days the color of the soil was selected as per the Varna or Cast. White soil is good for the Brahmans red for the Kshatriyas yellow for the Vaisyas and black for sudras. It was advised to dig 12 ft down. If the soil is black up to 3 ft down and white or red below that the land is suitable.\n",
      "Black and clayey soil is not good for building. If the soil is crumbly rock money comes without effort. Yellow soil is ideal for the business community.\n",
      "The materials that come up during the excavation for construction are indicators of the following results\n",
      "\n",
      "Soil test According to King Bhoj the ancient Indian Vastu Specialist dig a 2x2x2 hole and then fill it up again. If some soil left over after filling the land is good. If there is no soil left after filling up it is average. If the hole is not fully filled it is not good. This is the test to determine the soils natural moisture density and aeration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dig a 2x2x2 hole and fill it with water. If the time taken to absorb the water is more than an hour it is good. After the water is absorbed if there are many cracks in the hole the foundation of the house must be extra strong and will cost more.\n",
      "From whom to purchase According to Vastu sastra you should not purchase land from the following types of people\n",
      "From those who have became insolvent.\n",

      "Before installing the land it should be cleared. Dirt stones holes in the ground and trash should be removed. Thorny bushes should also be uprooted and removed.\n",
      "The installation should not be done if a woman in the household is more than seven months pregnant. The groundbreaking ceremony for the house should only be done during the Uttarayan period when the sun is in the northern hemisphere and when the days are longer than the nights from June 21 through December 20.\n",
      "Construction should not stop once it begins. Workers should not be unnecessarily pushed to speed up their work work for the day should stop at sunset. No construction should be done at night. A qualified engineer should always oversee the construction.\n",
      "Building materials should be stored in the southwest corner of the property during construction. The storage area or structure can also be built in the southeast corner at least 1m 3 ft from the property boundary. The guard should stay in a house in the southeast corner.

      "Well or Water Source\n",
      "It is advised that the first construction project for the new house is to dig the well. If water is used from this well for the construction it is auspicious for the family who will live in the house. It is best that the well or water source is on the north or northeast side of the land or if water comes from the municipality it should enter from the northeast side. If you draw a line from the southeast corner to the northeast corner the well should be to the right or left of the line not on it.\n",
      "The well can also be in the north or east sides of the property. The well should not be in the northwest or southeast corners as this is inauspicious. It is especially inauspicious if the well is dug in the southwest corner. It is also inauspicious to have a well in the middle of a house.\n",
      "Wells should be round. Ideally the well water should be exposed to sunlight for five hours a day. It is not recommended to share wells between two properties.\n",
      "The well should be dug after puja worship has been performed on the land at an astrologically auspicious time. This will insure that the water will be pure.\n",
      "The well should be dug under an auspicious star such as Rohini Hasta Uttara Bhadrapada Uttara etc. It should be dug on an auspicious daya Monday Wednesday Thursday or Friday. The well should be dug during a downwardfacing constellation or star such as Krittika Purva Phalguni Mula Bharani Ashlesha Purva Bhadrapada or Purvashadha.Water departing from the kitchen and bathroom should flow to the northeast and leave the house from this side.\n",

      "\n",
      "sides. If this is not possible then the north and east sides should be a minimum of 8cm 3 inches shorter.\n",
      "Do not set the gate on the south side. It is best that there are two gates to the compound so evil things entering one gate will exit from the other.\n",
      "Obstructions in front of the main gate Several types of obstructions before the main gate must be avoided as they give rise to the following problems according to Brahusanhita  Vasturaja Vallabha.\n",

      "These are called Vedha Doshas. But in between the plot and obstacles if there is a public road these deficiencies are nullified.\n",
      "Similarly if the distance between the obstacles and the house is two times the height of the house these deficiencies will have no effect. For example if the height of the house is 11 feet and if the obstructions are more than 22 feet away Vedh Dosha does not occur.\n",

It is not good to plant a tall tree on the north northeast or east sides of a building.\n",
      "Smaller trees may be planted on the east or north sides but no trees should be planted in the northeast corner. Tall trees should not be too close to a building as they block the sunlight. A trees shadow should not fall on the house. Large trees should not be located too near the house as their roots can damage the foundation and compound wall. Also the roots of large trees absorb sunlight quickly meaning these positive rays will not be received by the building. Do not allow tree branches to touch the house.\n",
